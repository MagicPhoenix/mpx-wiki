You should be able to get around 110 Hz on X axis and 75 Hz on Y axis.



## Mechanical

### Screws

Make sure all screws are tighteded.

### Pulley grub screws (AWD Only)

We recommend to tighten the rear pulleys' grub screws, they should align to the flat of stepper shaft.

Then move the toolhead by hand a few times at full travel. After that you can tighten the front pulleys.

Notice the front pulleys' grub screws shound't align to the flat shaft. 


## Belt

## Belt Tension 

You should get 160-180Hz/150mm, A/B belts must have same tension.

When adjusting, you have to loosen the 4 screws per rear stepper.

After adjustment is done, remember to tighten them.
