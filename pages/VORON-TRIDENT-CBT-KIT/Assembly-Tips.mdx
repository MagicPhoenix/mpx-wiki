## Trident Assembly Tips

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">

The kit's packaging is designed by the assembly sequence.  We strongly recommend not taking parts and pieces out of each layer. You can take every layer out but keep them as layers with parts intact.

<Callout type="info">

These Assembly Tips are specific to the Trident. You will also need to refer to the [General Assembly Tips](../GENERAL-KIT/Assembly-Tips.mdx) that are common to the V2.4 and the Trident. The V2.4-specific assembly tips are [here](../VORON-2.4-CBT-KIT/Assembly-Tips.mdx).

#### Packing Layer #1

Notice the color on the foam and the frame.

#### Packing Layer #2

There's only one extrusion in this layer, it's the yellow one.

## Y Endstop 

1.Install two M3 inserts into these 2 holes.

2.Use M3x8 SHCS to mount the Y endstop PCB

3.Install on gantry 

They should install on the A drive. You need M5x16 BHCS and M3x25 SHCS here

## Umbilical

The V2.4 uses a steel wire [as shown here](../VORON-2.4-CBT-KIT/Umbilical-Guide#toolhead) to provide additional support to the umbilical (reverse Bowden + Canbus cable). This wire is *not provided* for the Trident: the way the reverse Bowden tube enters from the top of the printer makes this wire unnecessary. Simply run the Canbus cable through the slot in the "A Motor" mount and cable gland, and then zip-tie it to the reverse Bowden for support. You can print this [Bowden Tube Guide](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/Galvanic/Bowden_Tube_Guide) once your printer is up and running to provide additional support.

## Frame Wiring

Instead of the printed wire clip, we add more extrusion covers in the kit.

You can use them to hide the wires.

Once again, remember to refer to the [General Assembly Tips](../GENERAL-KIT/Assembly-Tips.mdx) for those parts of the build common between the V2.4 and the Trident (Stealthburner, Tap, etc)
