# Assembly Tips and Tricks

## Note



import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'



<Callout type="info">
The packing is designed by the assemble sequence.

We strongly recommend not taking parts and pieces out of each layer. You can take every layer out but keep them as layers with parts intact.

## Video

Westy has made a great whole build video.

You can check it on YouTube : [https://youtu.be/NyzIomK4mwo?si=PvFvC9TIxJvjpHf7](https://youtu.be/NyzIomK4mwo?si=PvFvC9TIxJvjpHf7)

## Layer #2 &amp; #3

With these 2 layers, you are able to install Z Drive/Z rails and deck panel.

After this there would be XY steppers left, keep them for the next layer.

You may need M5 shims for mounting DIN rails, add 5x10x1 spacer to 4x M5x10 BHCS.

### Tips

You may need to remove one or more sections of cable chains according to your build size.

## Layer #5

This layer includes other all parts, including wires, electronic parts and toolhead parts etc.

After this layer you should be able to print parts.

## Layer #6

Panels. All clear panels and bottom/back black panel.

## Back Panel

Follow our print guide.

You need to apply 3mm thick foam tape on the edge of  `Exhaust_cover.stl` and you need to install 2xM3 inserts on this part. 



## Electronics Mount

### LRS-200-24

To make the wiring look cleaner, it's mounting different from the official manual, you need to print these files. Check our Print Guide

They should look like this pic. Use 4x M4x6 BHCS to mount it.

### Nevermore

## PEI / Buildplate / Heater

The bed heater is pre-installed on the build plate, but you need to install the magnetic sheet yourself.

The PEI and magnetic plate included in our kit are slightly larger than the buildplate size on purpose, so that you don't have to align them precisely when placing the spring steel. After sticking them on, you can use a blade to trim off the excess part.



## Stealthburner

For the CW2 thumb screw washer, you need to use a 3x7x0.5 washer instead of the black one.
