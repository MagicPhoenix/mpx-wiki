# CBT Kit Manta M8P V2 + CB1 Start Guide
## Introduction
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
MPX kits started shipping the V2 version of the Manta M8P in late 2023. If you have the older V1 version of the Manta, please refer to the [Flash M8P V1 and EBB SB2209](./flash-m8p-v1-ebb.mdx) page.
</Callout>

There are three microprocessors involved in running the printer: the one on the CB1, the one on the Manta M8P, and the one on the EBB SB2209 toolboard. Knowing how they all work together is important. The CB1 runs the show, the Manta gets delegated low level tasks like driving motors and fans from the CB1, and the EBB runs the Stealthburner in cooperation with the Manta.

Both the Manta and the EBB run Klipper. However, you will be compiling a different version of Klipper for each board because their processors are different (though the same source code is used for each). There is also something called CanBoot that you will be compiling for the EBB as well. Canboot is what allows future updates of Klipper on the EBB to be done via Canbus instead of USB i.e. over the existing wiring of your completed printer.

The process to get this all working is as follows:
- First you will get the CB1 processor board up and running by creating a TF card with a Linux image created by BigTreeTech ([Flash CB1](#flash-cb1)).
- Next you will get Klipper running on the processor running on the Manta. That is the big chip in the middle of the board. ([Flash M8P](#flash-m8p)).
- Next step is putting Canboot on the toolhead board with a connection between them that is initially USB so it can talk Canbus later. You do this because the toolboard isn't be able to talk Canbus out of the box ([Flash Canboot to EBB by USB](#flash-canboot-to-ebb-by-usb)).
- The last big step is putting Klipper on the toolhead board because both ends need that for this whole thing to work ([Flash Klipper to EBB by USB](#flash-klipper-to-ebb-by-usb)).
- After this, there are some final checks that everything is working ([Flash Checks](#flash-checks)). There is a ([Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)) section at the end as well in case of problems.

<Callout type="info">
If you have never done anything like this before, relax. Short of letting the magic smoke out, any mistakes in flashing are easily fixed by reflashing the bootloader and starting over. If you are unsure about anything, ask in the MPX discord, we will help you.
</Callout>


## Preparation

You need to provide a USB Type-C cable to plug into the Manta that can provide 5V output. We recommend USB-Type A to Type C cables.

<Callout type="warning">
Some Power Delivery chargers may output more than 5V via USB-C to USB-C type cables that in turn could burn out your M8P. Some also won't negotiate enough power to run the M8P at all. See the ([Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)) section for more details.
</Callout>

In addition, some PC USB ports don't have enough power to run the Manta plus the EBB, causing random issues. USB 3.0 ports should be OK but older USB 2.0 ports might be problematic as they are limited to 500 mA of current.

### Wiring

We strongly recommend flashing the M8P and the EBB before installing them into the printer. Wire them as shown.

> This pic is M8P V1. For V2 the only difference is the Canbus port position has changed.

![image-20230319031735759](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/19/64160e52492e4.webp)

<Callout type="warning">
Do not connect the red and black wires on the Canbus cable or this will short out 5V to ground and let the magic smoke out. Do not leave them dangling as shown in the picture above. It is better to insulate the end of the red and black wires by tape or some other means to prevent accidental contact between the two wires, or between the wires and the Manta.
</Callout>

Connect the green and yellow Canbus data wires to the Manta. This picture shows the header on the Manta V2 where the connection is made.

![image-20231012021503707](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/10/12/6526e6354a242.webp)

Next we need to install some jumpers on the Manta and EBB so the two boards can be flashed. Note that there are **three** different sizes of jumpers so make sure you use the right size for each connection. The two largest sizes are packaged with the Manta for use on that board. The smallest size (circled in red below) are packaged with the EBB and used exclusively with it. The EBB jumpers can be hard to find: look for them mixed in with some connectors and pins for that board.

<Callout type="warning">
The jumpers should be the same width as the headers they plug in to and should fit snugly. Using the wrong-sized jumper has been the source of numerous problems because of the intermittent connection that results.
</Callout>

![Jumpers.webp](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2024/05/05/663665411771e.webp)

Connect the following jumpers and leave them connected until the checks at the end of this process are completed.
- V_USB (largest-sized jumper) and 120R (medium-sized jumper) on M8P
- USB_5V and 120R on EBB SB (smallest-sized jumper)

![image-20231012021714644](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/10/12/6526e6b01034f.webp)

![image-20230327115407076](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/27/6421136211267.webp)

This pic is made by @Westy_Pity_Da_Fool. It may be helpful in understanding the wiring. Note that while it isn't shown clearly here, you also need to plug a USB cable between the Manta and the EBB SB2209 as well.

![Image](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/08/22/64e4a315902c0.webp)

Wiring:
- USB cable from computer or wall supply to the M8P USB-C port.
- USB Type-A to Type-C Data cable from one of the M8P USB-A ports to the EBB SB USB-C port. It is best to use the one that came packaged with the Manta as this is known to work well.
- Canbus cable from EBB SB to M8P (Canbus two pin connector only. The red and black power wires should be taped off for safety.)

### Flash CB1

Download the latest image name starting with `CB1_Debian11_Klipper` from [the BTT Github](https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB1/releases)

Then use `balenaEtcher ` to flash it into your TF card. You don't need to unzip the image. 

When the flash is done, replug the TF card in your PC. You should be able to access the BOOT partition on the card from your PC's file manager of choice.

![image-20230319215101298](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/19/6417134728f27.webp)

Edit `system.cfg` and change the WIFI setting to yours by replacing the values within the quotes (do not delete the quotes themselves).

![image-20230319215221809](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/19/6417139804c92.webp)

That's all. Now just eject the card from the PC, install the card to the M8P, and install the CB1 to the M8P.

<Callout type="warning">
The TF card must install to the `SOC-CARD`, not the `MCU-CARD` slot.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
It takes more force than you'd expect to install the CB1 on the M8P. You will feel it snap into place when properly inserted. Visually inspect the CB1 after mounting to ensure that the CB1 is flush against the Manta on all four corners.
</Callout>

![image-20230327115012657](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/27/6421127c71b33.webp)

Now power on and wait a few minutes, you should be able to see the CB1 IP address in your router. 

 ![image-20230319220132540](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/19/641715bf451ad.webp)

Use your browser to visit the IP address shown on your router. The Mainsail web interface should be displayed.

### [Optional] Update

We recommend updating Klipper to the latest version before proceeding.
![image-20230319014058625](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/19/6415f7ac70442.webp)

### Set CB1 Can Bridge Bitrate

These instructions and many of those that follow are done on the CB1 itself. The CB1 is accessed via an SSH terminal interface. How you do this is up to you. You *can* use a program like Mobaxterm to give you a bit of a GUI interface, but most people choose to use the Command Prompt on Windows or a Terminal program on MacOS / Linux.

<Callout type="info">
We use a ```$``` symbol to show most of the single line commands you need to type into the command line (like the ```ssh``` command that follows). Commands that might generate a lot of output from the CB1 are preceded with something that looks like ```biqu@BTT-CB1:~```, and will be followed by the expected output from the CB1 in various colors.
</Callout>

Use ```ssh``` to access the CB1 from your PC:

```shell
$ ssh biqu@192.168.2.10
biqu@192.168.2.10's password:biqu  (<-- Password will not be echoed to screen)
```

<Callout type="info">
You might get a warning the first time you ssh into the CB1. Acknowledge any prompt and proceed as we know this connection is a safe one.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
If it wasn't clear from the above above, the CB1 is accessed with the username ```biqu``` and password ```biqu```.
</Callout>

Next we need to make sure that the CB1 uses the proper Canbus data rate. This information is stored in a configuration file that we will edit with a simple editor called ```nano```. The editor name is preceded by ```sudo```, telling Linux that we want to run this as a superuser with unlimited powers and permissions.
```
$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0
```

Enter the password ```biqu``` if prompted. Depending on which BTT image you are using, you might need to create this file from scratch *or* edit an existing file provided by BTT.  If the latter, change the bitrate value to 1000000 if necessary and any other values as required. Whether you ending up having to create this file or edit an existing file, it should look *exactly* like this when you are done. 


<Callout type="warning">
A single typo here can lead to tricky problems later.
</Callout>

```
allow-hotplug can0
iface can0 can static
    bitrate 1000000
    up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
```

Save the file within the editor with Ctrl-O and then Enter to acknowledge. 

### Disable Unnecessary Services

By default, the BTT image for the CB1 runs several background services that are not properly configured by default and will repeatedly fail and restart every few seconds.  One service called `hostapd` tries to turn your printer into a wireless hotspot.  The other service called `klipper-mcu` allows use of the CB1 processor's GPIO and SPI ports as if it was a second MCU on top of the one already built into the Manta. Neither of these services is required for our purposes, and disabling them will ease the workload on the CB1 and minimize spam in your error logs.

Assuming you are still connected to your printer via `ssh` from the previous step, enter these two commands to disable the two services.
``` shell
$ sudo systemctl disable hostapd
$ sudo systemctl disable klipper-mcu
```

Your command and the resulting output should look like this:

``` shell
biqu@BTT-CB1:~$ sudo systemctl disable hostapd
Synchronizing state of hostapd.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install disable hostapd
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/hostapd.service.
biqu@BTT-CB1:~$ sudo systemctl disable klipper-mcu
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/klipper-mcu.service.
```

<Callout type="info">
If you have no use for KlipperScreen (the software that supports the printer's touchscreen GUI), you can disable it now or in the future with:
```shell
$ sudo systemctl disable KlipperScreen
```
</Callout>

Reboot the CB1 from the command line for these changes and those in the previous section to take effect:
```
biqu@Voron:~$ reboot
```

### Canbus Interface Check

Before moving on, let's verify that the Canbus interface is set up properly after the reboot of the CB1 in the previous step. `ssh` back into the printer and enter the following:

``` shell
$ ip -details link show can0
```

Your command and the resulting output should look something like this. Verify the `qlen` value of `1024` and the `bitrate` value of `1000000` appears in the output. If they don't, you most likely have a typo in your `/etc/network/interfaces.d/can0` file. Edit the file as necessary, reboot the CB1, and run this check until the `qlen` & `bitrate` values are correct.


``` shell
biqu@Voron:~$ ip -details link show can0
3: can0: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1024
    link/can  promiscuity 0 minmtu 0 maxmtu 0

          clock 48000000 numtxqueues 1 numrxqueues 1 gso_max_size 65536 gso_max_segs 65535
```

## Flash M8P

<Callout type="info">
If you run into a problem flashing the M8P in this section or the EBB in the next sections, check out the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) at the bottom of this page for ideas.
</Callout>


```shell
$ cd ~/klipper
$ make menuconfig
```

Then set everything up as shown. Use the arrow keys to navigate and Enter to change selections. Enter will also take you into sub-menus indicated by ```--->```

```

```

![KlipperMantaConfig2.webp](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2024/04/15/661c5bae827cb.webp)

Press Q to save and then run `make` from the terminal.

```shell
$ make
```

<Callout type="info">
If you realize you've run "make" with incorrect settings, you can always go back and do ```make menuconfig```, then ```make``` again.
</Callout>

This will create the Klipper firmware file `out/klipper.bin` for the Manta.

Next we will flash it to the Manta with DFU. To enter DFU mode, press on BOOT0 and click the RESET button (i.e. Press and hold BOOT0, press and release RESET, release BOOT0, all on the Manta).

<Callout type="warning">
Both the M8P here and the EBB later have the same USB ID when in DFU mode, so you should only ever put one of them in DFU mode at a time or you risk flashing the wrong device.
</Callout>

![image-20231012022256313](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/10/12/6526e8049db89.webp)

Let's verify that the Manta is in DFU mode:
```
$ lsusb
```

![image-20230319015826219](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/04/29/644c499b9642d.webp)

There should be a DFU Mode device found. Record its ID, but normally it's `0483:df11`. Now flash it.

```
$ make flash FLASH_DEVICE=0483:df11
```

Your command and the resulting output should look like this:

```shell
biqu@BTT-CB1:~/klipper$ make flash FLASH_DEVICE=0483:df11
  Flashing out/klipper.bin to 0483:df11

If the device is already in bootloader mode it can be flashed with the
following command:
  make flash FLASH_DEVICE=0483:df11
  OR
  make flash FLASH_DEVICE=1209:beba

If attempting to flash via 3.3V serial, then use:
  make serialflash FLASH_DEVICE=0483:df11

make: *** [src/stm32/Makefile:100: flash] Error 255
```

If it shows like this, then you have flashed it successfully, 

Now click the RST button on the Manta to restart the M8P (it won't restart CB1).

Check M8P Can uuid:

```
$ python3 lib/canboot/flash_can.py -q
```

Your command and the resulting output should look like this:

```shell
biqu@BTT-CB1:~/klipper$ python3 lib/canboot/flash_can.py -q

```

Record your M8P can uuid. It is `4b94c57be78e` in this example. Yours should be different.

## Flash Canboot to EBB by USB

If you didn't do it at the start of this process, plug the USB-5V and 120R jumpers on the EBB and connect it to the M8P via a USB-A to USB-C data cable like that provided with the Manta.

As noted in the introduction, we need to flash Canboot to the EBB before we flash Klipper to it.

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/Arksine/CanBoot
$ cd CanBoot
$ make menuconfig
```

<Callout type="info">
Canboot was recently renamed to Katapult. Read one as the other and you'll be fine.

Press Q to save and then run `make` from the terminal.

```shell
$ make
```


Hold down the BOOT button and click RST on the EBB SB to put the EBB into DFU mode. Let's check if it worked:

`$ lsusb`

![image-20230319022359143](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/19/641601c0bbce3.webp)

There should be another DFU device `0483:df11`

Now we can flash Canboot to the EBB.

```shell
$ dfu-util -a 0 -d 0483:df11 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 -D ~/CanBoot/out/canboot.bin
```

Your command and the resulting output should look like this:

## Flash Klipper to EBB by USB

Remember in the Introduction we said we were going to flash Klipper to both the Manta and the EBB?  We already did the Manta so now it is the EBB's turn.

```
$ cd ~/klipper
$ make menuconfig
```

```

```shell
$ make
```

Set EBB SB2209 to DFU mode by holding BOOT and clicking RST to enter DFU mode. Then run `lsusb`

![image-20230319024157881](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/19/641605f7a7250.webp)

Flash it

```
$ dfu-util -a 0 -d 0483:df11 --dfuse-address 0x08002000 -D out/klipper.bin
```

<Callout type="info">
Note how the address is 0x08002000 here vs the 0x08000000 when canboot was flashed. This prevents the first flash on the toolhead from being overwritten by the second
</Callout>

## Flash Checks

<Callout type="info">
The python-based checks don't always work right, and some people have more luck than others getting them to work. Powering everything down and back up might increase your chances of getting them working. Generally speaking, if the flash commands complete successfully and the output looked as expected, it *should* be OK.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
The Manta and the EBB were flashed over USB in the previous steps, but these checks in the next steps are done via Canbus. You **must** have your Canbus cable connected as shown in the [Wiring](#wiring) section of this guide for these checks to work
</Callout>

1. Canboot Check 

Double click the RST button on the EBB. The red LED should blink.

```
$ cd ~/klipper
$ python3 lib/canboot/flash_can.py -q
```

If it shows like this, then Canboot has flashed successfully.

```shell
biqu@BTT-CB1:~/klipper$ python3 lib/canboot/flash_can.py -q
Resetting all bootloader node IDs...
Checking for canboot nodes...
Detected UUID: 4b94c57be78e, Application: Klipper
Detected UUID: 2f0b1ce14660, Application: CanBoot

```

2. Klipper Check

Click the RST Button on the EBB. The LED shouldn't blink anymore.

```
$ python3 lib/canboot/flash_can.py -q
```

If it shows like this, Klipper has flashed successfully.

```shell
biqu@BTT-CB1:~/klipper$ python3 lib/canboot/flash_can.py -q
Resetting all bootloader node IDs...
Checking for canboot nodes...
Detected UUID: 4b94c57be78e, Application: Klipper

```

![image-20230319031104014](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2023/03/19/64160cc9b2011.webp)

All flash work is done. Now `4b94c57be78e` is your M8P uuid, and `2f0b1ce14660` is your toolboard uuid.

Use these to replace the placeholder uuid values in`printer.cfg`. You can use the text editor built into the Mainsail web interface to easily make these changes. This annotated screenshot points out the key parts of the interface you'll need to know about for this.
![Mainsail Interface](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2024/01/24/65aff0f1451af.webp)

You should end up with something that looks like this in your ```printer.cfg``` file, replacing the `canbus_uuid` values for the Manta MCU and the EBB with your values.  When your edits are done, select "SAVE & RESTART" from the top right corner of the editor.
``` shell
#####################################################################
#   UUID Setting
#####################################################################
[mcu]
canbus_uuid:4b94c57be78e    

[mcu EBBCan]
canbus_uuid: 2f0b1ce14660
```

Finally, remove the `v_usb` jumper on the M8P and `usb_5v` jumper on the EBB SB. Keep the 120R jumper on both the M8P and the EBB.

## Troubleshooting 

**Problem**: The Manta and the CB1 aren't powering up even though they are connected to a supply that should have lots of power.
- Did you install the V_USB jumper on the Manta?
- Are you using a USB-C power supply for a phone? Some USB-C power supplies will try to negotiate with the device they are connected to and this doesn't always work well for the Manta. Anker USB-C power supplies for phones are [known to be problematic](https://discord.com/channels/707214359582998650/887356023873089607/1235782465164017694).

**Problem**: I can't see the EBB Toolhead using `lsusb` after flashing the Manta but its Power LED is on.
- Verify that you are connecting the EBB via one of the two USB-A connections on the Manta V2. The USB-C port on the Manta isn't supported for flashing the EBB.
- Verify that you are using a USB data cable and not a charging cable
- Try a different cable. More than one person has had problems because of a bad cable.
- Make sure the USB-C cable is plugged *firmly* into the EBB. It will click into place when properly connected. If only pushed in halfway, it will provide power but won't provide data.

**Problem**: I can't see the EBB Toolhead using `lsusb` after flashing the Manta and its Power LED is off.
- Verify that you connected the USB_5V jumper on the EBB with the smallest sized jumper packaged with the EBB

**Problem**: I flashed the Manta board and I see an Openmoko entry for it with `lsusb` after doing so, but it disappears from `lsusb` after I reset the Manta or cycle power.
- The Manta bootloader has probably been corrupted, possibly by flashing the EBB Canboot image to the Manta instead of the EBB by mistake. Follow [these instructions on the BTT Github](https://github.com/bigtreetech/Manta-M8P/tree/master/V2.0/Firmware) to restore the bootloader on the Manta.

**Problem**: I flashed the Manta board and I see an OpenMoko entry for it with `lsusb` even after I reset the Manta or cycle power. I double checked my `make menuconfig` setup and that looks good too. But I get errors like this when I try to get the Manta UUID with `flash_can.py`.

```shell

- Double check your `/etc/network/interfaces.d/can0` file for typos. It needs to look *exactly* like that shown in the section on [Setting the CB1 Can Bridge Bitrate](#set-cb1-can-bridge-bitrate)

**Problem**: I am trying to flash the Manta / EBB but the system is not stable. The Canbus connection disconnects and reconnects, interfaces disappear and reappear, etc.
- You might have a weak USB power supply. We have seen instances where a marginal supply will cause the Manta to drop in and out while the CB1 operates normally. Or the CB1 and Manta might operate OK but the setup becomes unstable when the SB2209 is connected. Switch to a power supply / USB port that can provide more current and see if the problem goes away.

**Problem**: I am using a Raspberry Pi CM4 instead of the BigTreeTech CB1 and ```username: biqu```, ```password: biqu``` does not work for me.
- See the BTT manual. For this board it should be ```username: pi```, ```password: raspberry```
