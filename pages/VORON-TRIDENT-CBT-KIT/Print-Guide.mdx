# Print Guide

## STL Files


All MPX-specific printed parts are available as STL's [on our Github](https://github.com/MagicPhoenix/MPX-VORON-TRIDENT-CBT). There's also a printed parts list for the entire kit in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1netssmQvMHU4L7ZRPP_Dsb0WIGYNufr2CalAo0eR884/edit?usp=sharing) that may be helpful to you.

<Callout type="warning">
The items listed below are not a comprehensive list of the deltas from the official Voron Trident. Refer to the [V2.4 Print Guide](../VORON-2.4-CBT-KIT/Print-Guide.mdx) for parts common to the Trident and the V2.4 (Stealthburner, Tap, etc). The Google Doc linked above should be considered the definitive reference.
