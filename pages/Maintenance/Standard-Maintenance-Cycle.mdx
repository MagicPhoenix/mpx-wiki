# Standard Maintenance Cycle

## Common Parts (excl. Toolhead)

### First 100 hours printing

* Check Belt tension 
* Check if the bolts are tightened (mainly XY Joints and A/B Drivers)



### Cycle Maintenance

| Part                                       | Check Cycle (hours) | Replace Cycle (hours) |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Belt tension                               | 1000                |                       |
| bolts tightened                            | 1000                |                       |
| Lube rails                                 | 1000                |                       |
| PTFE tube (From spool to toolhead 4x3 one) |                     | 1000                  |



### Service life of motion parts

* Belts: it should be fine after 5000hrs printing under 400mm/s @ 10K acc.
* Pulleys: usually maintenance free.
* Bearings: it should be fine after 3000hrs printing under 400mm/s @ 10K acc.
* Idlers: it should be fine after 3000hrs printing under 400mm/s @ 10K acc.

There may be abnormal noises from bearings or idlers after 3000hrs printing, in this case you can try to apply a bit more grease.



## Toolhead Maintenance

Depending on the filament used, there may be significant differences

| Parts                        | Replace Cycle(normal filaments) | Replace Cycle(fibre filaments) |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Nozzle - Standard            | 50kg+                           | 2kg @ max                      |
| Nozzle - Hardened Steel      | 200kg+                          | 5kg                            |
| Nozzle - DLC                 | 200kg+                          | 10kg+                          |
| Extruder Gear - Standard     | 200kg+                          | 20kg+                          |
| Extruder Gear - RNC          | 200kg+                          | 50kg+                          |
| Extruder Gear Bearing (MR85) | 100kg+                          | 100kg+                         |

## Handling Unexpected Situations

### Spaghetti

Check List: 

* Check whether there is filament stuck in the hotend fan (Important)
* Check whether there is filament stuck in the Z Drive
