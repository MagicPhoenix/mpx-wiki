# Sensorless Homing Setup On M8P V2
## Introduction
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Sensorless homing makes use of the stallguard feature built into the TMC2209 stepper drivers plugged into the Manta M8P for the A & B motors that drive the toolhead on X & Y. Canbus and the integrated Y-endstop / chamber temperature sensor in the MPX kits requires some changes from the [standard sensorless homing procedure documented in the Voron site](https://docs.vorondesign.com/community/howto/clee/sensorless_xy_homing.html). Nevertheless, you still want to read that page over as much of it is still applicable. This writeup will focus more on the deltas from that writeup vs. detailing the procedure in full.

Getting a basic understanding of how sensorless homing works now will be useful for setup and troubleshooting later. In short:
- The physical endstop switches are either not installed (X-endstop on Stealthburner) or not connected (Y-endstop near A motor)
- The stepper drivers plus a bit of configuration in `printer.cfg` provide a signal that is either Low in normal operation (endstop not triggered) or High (endstop triggered).
- The signal from the stepper drivers gets to the Manta CPU via connection of something called the DIAG jumpers. This means three things in practice:
    - **First**: The physical endstops *must* not be installed / connnected or they will interfere with the operation of sensorless homing.  **The DIAG jumper connection takes the place of the physical endstop connection**.
    - **Second**: The EBB SB2209 is no longer involved with homing at all. We will not install the X-endstop to the toolhead and we will completely remove the reference to this endstop in our `printer.cfg`
    - **Third**: The wiring from the MPX Y-endstop / chamber thermistor will need to be re-pinned so we can retain the chamber temperature function.

## DIAG Jumper Installation

This part is straightforward. You need to install the DIAG jumper for both the A & B steppers motors as shown in this picture. These jumpers are *in addition to* the other jumpers that you installed [when you set up the Manta for flashing](../Firmware-Flash/flash-m8p-v2-ebb.mdx).

<Callout type="info">
This picture shows the Manta V1 but the DIAG jumpers are in exactly the same place for Manta V2.  Note that the DIAG jumper connection requires the smaller of the two jumper sizes provided with the Manta by BTT.

## Wiring
### Stealthburner / EBB SB2209

The X-endstop on the Stealthburner can be removed / not installed. It *probably* doesn't do any harm to have it on and left connected because we will be removing all references to it in `printer.cfg`, but this is untested. A reason for leaving it connected might be if you wanted to switch back to physical endstops later.

### Y Endstop

What MPX calls the Y Endstop PCB *also* includes a very small thermistor that is used for measuring the chamber temperature. We want to retain this capability so we still want to install that PCB and we still need to run the wiring to it.  However,a bit of cable re-pinning will be required to get everything to work. Refer to the picture below. The green lines illustrate the original MPX wiring. The blue lines indicate where we want to end up after re-pinning.

![Connection Changes](https://img.mpx.wiki/i/2024/01/25/65b17599bfeca.webp)

On both the three pin connectors, ground is the middle pin. The "Y Endstop PCB" has both a thermistor (across pins 2 & 3) and a switch (across pins 1 & 2). Re-pin the middle wire (“4”) from the "Y-Endstop" connector to “2” on the "Chamber Thermistor" connector. This relocates the Ground to the thermistor connection so that the M8P can read it. The wiring should now match the blue lines. The "Chamber Thermistor" will plug in to its original spot on the Manta. The "Y Endstop" connector can be left disconnected and tucked away in the PVC wiring channel in case you want to revert back to physical endstops later.

<Callout type="info">
It might also work to leave the pinouts as-is and just plug the 3-pin "Y Endstop" connector into another unused endstop connector on the Manta board. That would be another way to provide a Ground to the Y Endstop PCB, but this is untested.

## Initial Software Configuration
### Changes to printer.cfg

Before you run through the [Voron Initial Startup Checks](https://docs.vorondesign.com/build/startup/), you will need to make some software configuration changes to enable sensorless homing. We assume at this point that you know your way around the Mainsail interface well enough to upload new configuration files and edit existing files.

Per [the official sensorless homing writeup](https://docs.vorondesign.com/community/howto/clee/sensorless_xy_homing.html), we will do the following in our `printer.cfg` file:
- set the `homing_retract_dist` to `0`
- set our X and Y `homing_speed` values to half of the `rotation_distance`
- modify the `endstop_pin` values for `[stepper_x]` and `[stepper_y]`
- update the `endstop_pin`'s to use the `virtual_endstop` and add failsafe pullups with the `^` symbol where required.

This is an example of the required changes for a 300mm Trident. There *might* be a few differences with other printers, but the endstop pin configuration is common between the different sizes and Trident / V2.4. We'll start with the Y endstop as it is the simpler of the two.  Edit your `printer.cfg` file as follows (remember that `#` indicates a comment line that Klipper ignores):

Before:
```
## Y Stepper on Motor2 (A Motor)
[stepper_y]
...
rotation_distance: 40
endstop_pin: ^PF3
...
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
homing_speed: 100  #Max 100
homing_retract_dist: 5
homing_positive_dir: true

[tmc2209 stepper_y]
...
stealthchop_threshold: 0
```

After:
```
## Y Stepper on Motor2 (A Motor)
[stepper_y]
...
rotation_distance: 40
# endstop_pin: ^PF3
endstop_pin: tmc2209_stepper_y:virtual_endstop
...
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
homing_speed: 20  #Max 100
homing_retract_dist: 0
homing_positive_dir: true

[tmc2209 stepper_y]
...
stealthchop_threshold: 0
diag_pin: ^PF3
driver_SGTHRS: 255 # 255 is most sensitive value, 0 is least sensitive
```
As the Voron guide suggests, the Y motor now has a `homing_speed` half that of `rotation_distance`, `homing_retract_dist` is set to `0`, and the `endstop_pin` on the y-axis is now configured to be a `virtual_endstop`. In addition, the `[tmc2209 stepper y]` section contains a `diag_pin` value that is cut and pasted from the `[stepper_y]` section, and there is a new value `driver_SGTHRS` set to its most sensitive value of `255`. 

<Callout type="warning">
Not reducing the `homing_speed` as shown above may result in sensorless homing not working at best, and your printhead slamming into a rail at high speed with your motors grinding against the belts at worst.
</Callout>

Now let's change the x-axis, and here is where it gets a bit tricky.

Before:
```
## X Stepper on Motor1(B Motor)
[stepper_x]
...
rotation_distance: 40
endstop_pin: ^EBBCan: PB6
...
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
homing_speed: 100   #Max 100
homing_retract_dist: 5
homing_positive_dir: true

[tmc2209 stepper_x]
...
stealthchop_threshold: 0
```

After:
```
## X Stepper on Motor1(B Motor)
[stepper_x]
...
rotation_distance: 40
# endstop_pin: ^EBBCan: PB6
endstop_pin: tmc2209_stepper_x:virtual_endstop
...
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
homing_speed: 20   #Max 100
homing_retract_dist: 0
homing_positive_dir: true

[tmc2209 stepper_x]
...
stealthchop_threshold: 0
# Must connect DIAG pin to M1-Stop on Manta (^PF4), and NOT ^EBBCan: PB6 !!!
diag_pin: ^PF4
driver_SGTHRS: 255 # 255 is most sensitive value, 0 is least sensitive
```

These changes on X are like that made on Y *except* for the `diag_pin` value.  Why is `^PF4` specified here instead of cutting and pasting `^EBBCan: PB6`  as we did on the Y axis???  Remember that our X axis limit switch is now the DIAG pin coming from TMC2209 stepper driver for the B Motor, which is "Motor 1" on the Manta Board. The EBB2209 toolboard is no longer involved in endstop detection. In fact, keeping the reference to `^EBBCan: PB6` in `printer.cfg` will cause this endstop to always show triggered, even when it isn't. But how do we know that `^PF4` is the right pin to specify???  We know from this picture [from the BTT Manta Manual](https://github.com/bigtreetech/Manta-M8P/blob/master/V2.0/BIGTREETECH%20MANTA%20M8P%20V2.0%20User%20Manual.pdf).

### Additional Configuration

We will now add a new configuration file that contains variables and macros specific for homing X and Y using stallguard rather than physical switches.
- Go to [this Github link](https://github.com/kyleisah/EZ-Klipper-Macros/blob/main/Config/Sensorless-Homing.cfg) and download @kyleisah's `Sensorless-Homing.cfg` to your PC [(Discord reference)](https://discord.com/channels/460117602945990666/551488536256184331/1191113725755789323)
- Review the variable definitions at the top of the file and make any changes you wish.  

<Callout type="info">
Trident users probably want to change `variable_first_homed_axis:` from `'X'` to `'Y'`: if the printhead happens to be at the front of the printer and X is homed first, the printhead will move all the way to the right and bump into the front-right leadscrew.
</Callout>

- Upload the file `Sensorless-Homing.cfg` to your printer where `printer.cfg` and all of the other configuration files are located
- Edit your `printer.cfg` file to include this configuration file. If you put it near the top of the file, it will look as shown below.

```
[include mainsail.cfg]
[include stealthburner_leds.cfg]
[include Sensorless-Homing.cfg]
...
```

The `printer.cfg` files provided by MPX include a `[safe_z_home]` section. Per the [Voron Guide](https://docs.vorondesign.com/community/howto/clee/sensorless_xy_homing.html#final-setup), we want to comment this out in `printer.cfg` well.  That section will look like this when you are done.

```
# [safe_z_home]
# home_xy_position:150,150
# speed:100
# z_hop:1
```

Be sure to save the `printer.cfg` file and restart the Klipper firmware when you are done.

## Next Steps

At this point, your printer is set up for sensorless homing for when you get to running the [initial startup checks](https://docs.vorondesign.com/build/startup/) for your printer. In particular, the ["Endstop Check" section](https://docs.vorondesign.com/build/startup/#endstop-check) will verify that all Endstops are open (not triggered). Because of the work you have done to this point, the `QUERY_ENDSTOPS` command should show
```
x:open y:open z:open
```
<Callout type="warning">
If *any* of the endstops show as "triggered", you have made a mistake somewhere, either in the wiring or the software setup. Do not proceed further until you find the problem and fix it.
</Callout>

The "Endstop Check" section of that guide will in turn reference the [Setting Up and Calibrating Sensorless XY Homing]( https://docs.vorondesign.com/community/howto/clee/sensorless_xy_homing.html) documentation. You'll need to pick up that guide from the section on [Finding the right StallGuard threshold](https://docs.vorondesign.com/community/howto/clee/sensorless_xy_homing.html#finding-the-right-stallguard-threshold). Note that the section on [Homing Macros](https://docs.vorondesign.com/community/howto/clee/sensorless_xy_homing.html#homing-macros) from that page is already taken care of by the `Sensorless-Homing.cfg` file that we uploaded previously. Also, the steps in the [Final Setup](https://docs.vorondesign.com/community/howto/clee/sensorless_xy_homing.html#final-setup) section have been taken care of already as well: we commented out the `[safe_z_home]` section previously and our `printer.cfg` file already contains a `[homing_override]` section because it is needed for Tap.
