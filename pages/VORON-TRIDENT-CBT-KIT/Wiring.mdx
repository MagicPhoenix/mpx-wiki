# Trident Wiring Guide

This page covers the wiring specific to the Trident printer. Please also review the [General Wiring Guide](../GENERAL-KIT/Wiring-Guide.mdx) for information common to both the V2.4 and the Trident (Stealthburner, Disco LEDs, etc).

## Before You Start

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure the 110V/230V switch on your LRS-200-24 power supply is in the right orientation.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
We strongly recommend you flash the M8P/SB2209 before you install them. This usually saves you 2 hours or more of work.  Check [this page](../Firmware-Flash/flash-m8p-v2-ebb.mdx) if you have a Manta M8P V2, [or this page](../Firmware-Flash/flash-m8p-v1-ebb.mdx) if you have a Manta M8P V1. Note that the kits have been shipping with V2 since late fall of 20223.
</Callout>

### BIGTREETECH SPI35 Touch Screen

We strongly recommend you install the Flat Flexible cable for the display on the Manta M8P side before you install the Manta on the DIN rails. The shiny contacts on the cable should face the board. The connector is on the back of the M8P.

##  Layout

Use 3M 5952 Tape to mount the PVC trunkings. We recommend you clean the area to be bonded with IPA (Isopropyl Alcohol) to ensure good adhesion.

Our PSU mounting is different from the official Voron one. Please refer to the [Print Guide](./Print-Guide.mdx) for instructions.

<Callout type="warning">
Note the orientation of the Solid State Relay (SSR). It has an AC side and a DC side. **You must be extremely careful** that you don't wire the SSR the wrong way around or you will damage it and, potentially, other parts of the printer as well.

## Toolboard 

Note: you need to remove the outer sheath of SB2209 cable for some length on electronic bay side.


### Toolboard 24V 

<Callout type="warning">

The default wires are tinned. Solder cold flows/creeps under load and can become a fire-hazard. You can crimp the connection with a pin terminal or cut them off and use bare wire in the terminal blocks instead.
