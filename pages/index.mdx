# MPX WIKI

Welcome to the MPX Wiki. It's goal is to document our two main printer kits
- The [Voron 2.4 CBT Kit](./VORON-2.4-CBT-KIT/Whats-This/BOM-List.mdx)
- The [Voron Trident CBT Kit](./VORON-TRIDENT-CBT-KIT/Trident-CBT-Bom.mdx) available in two versions: [Lite and Standard](./VORON-TRIDENT-CBT-KIT/About-Trident-Kit)

Need more help? Just jump on Discord and ask! There is the [MPX Channel on the Voron Discord](https://discord.com/channels/460117602945990666/701761252275257374). Most people learn about the Magic Phoenix kit from here. There is also the [dedicated MPX Discord](https://discord.gg/3Uhq6k7YSg). This tends to be the more active of the two specific to MPX printer kits.
